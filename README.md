<h1>A University Recommendation System </h1>
The following things were taken into consideration to make this system:
<ol>
  <li>Based on the student's score and choice of university decide whether the student will get admission in that particular university</li>
  <li>Now use clustering technique to find out what similar profile does the student match with so that they connect with those students and they can guide each other</li>
  <li>Then based on the student choice of university, decide which tier of colleges should the student focus on.</li>
</ol>
